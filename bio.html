Born in the suburban, university town of London Ontario, Abby McLean started 
performing around the age of six. Abby worshiped Britney Spears, watching the 
young, blonde, sparkly-pink pop-star radiate beauty and essence on stage to her 
devoted fans. She wanted to achieve that - pink sparkles and everything. Since 
then, her love of music has expanded to many other genres including bedroom 
pop, experimental, lo-fi pop and folk pop. After Abby 
graduated from highschool, she moved to Toronto, Ontario to pursue music as a 
career. She enrolled in Centennial College’s Music Industry Performing Arts 
program where 
she was fortunate to develop as an artist through practicing 
music in all forms. While enrolled, Abby specialized in 
vocals, demonstrated through weekly rehearsals and 
performances at Toronto Centre For The Arts. At school, 
Abby studied different branches of music creation 
including songwriting classes taught by Bob Wiseman of 
Blue Rodeo, as well as production classes. Through this, 
she was forced to challenge her technical side and learn 
music creation from a different angle. In her last year of 
school, Abby started collaborating with a producer she 
met, who at the time, she saw as a mentor and somewhat 
of a catalyst to her music career. But after two years of 
lackluster results and a chunk of her grandfather’s 
inheritance gone, she needed a break. This break was a 
moment to rediscover, regroup and reapproach her path to 
musicianship. It was a decision to find independence. She 
started studying guitar through weekly lessons, while also 
experimenting with her own production style. Abby now 
writes, records and produces all her work. In 2021, Abby 
uploaded her first self produced song titled Changes onto 
her Soundcloud, followed by I Know Where To Go, and 
continued to upload one every couple of months. In April 
2023, Abby released her first single Do You Find That 
You’re Wrong to all streaming services including Spotify 
and Apple Music. After a quiet six month apparatus 
focused on writing and producing, she has completed her first self-produced 
five song EP titled This is the End of the World which will be released early 
next year. It is ethereal and confrontational but also fun and weird, and of 
course no pink sparkles were left in the dust. She writes about real life 
themes through apocalyptic scenarios and makes references to ancient myths that 
she learned through her very own research. Themes of the upcoming EP include 
power, pain, resilience, love, heartbreak and fear. Abby continues to explore 
with her newfound creative freedom while she continues to enhance her vision 
for her future as an artist.
